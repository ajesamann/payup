***Notes***

In order to make the app work on all device sizes we need to do some things:

[] - Adjust font sizes using some type of device size recognizer.
[] - Figure out what containers will ALWAYS be the same size & the content will never change % wise on every device.
[] - Have margin and padding adjust accordingly per device using the same formula as the font.
